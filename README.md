# SoccerStats
Develop an algorithm for a Java program that reads data from a file. The data involves some soccer statistics. It includes the name of the soccer team, the
number of goals, and the number of shots per game. The program will read in this data, it will find the maximum and minimum number of goals scored by the teams along with the name of the team that
scored those goals. It will also find the average of the shots per game. The program will then output the results to a file called soccerSummary.txt. 
The fileâ€™s data should look like this:
Maximum goals Scored: Monaco 15
Minimum goals Scored: Athletic Bilbao 1
Average shots per game: 15.565
